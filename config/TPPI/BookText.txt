**This is the file that TPPI Tweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**

Greetings everyone, and welcome to Test Pack Please Ignore!~
~
~
We're really excited to bring this pack to you all.
~~~
We also couldn't have done so without the Feed The Beast subreddit community, 
who the pack is made by and for.~
~
Thank you all so very much for making TPPI possible!
~~~
This book you're reading is added by our own custom mod, TPPI Tweaks.~
~
It will always automatically contain the most up-to-date information 
on the pack, so check it often!~
~
Should you want a new copy, you can craft one with an iron ingot and three paper,
but this is not necessary to recieve new info!.
~~~
Another feature of TPPI Tweaks is the in-game commands it adds.~
~
The changelog can be found by typing /tppi changelog, which will of course always 
be up to date, no need to ever get a new copy.~
~
We're also working on a project to add in-game documentation for all 
the mods in the pack, to be accessed via commands.~
~~~
Type /tppi guide to receive an all-around guide to the documentation system, 
the easiest way to obtain info on any mod you wish.~
~~~
Type /tppi mods <modname> to get an individual book for a mod, or to get
a link if the mod has not had in-game documentation written for it yet.~
/tppi mods list will give you a list of all mods that are possible to be used in the command.
~~~
Naturally, this is a big job, and it's not yet finished.
~
It is our hope that the community will get 
involved in documenting these mods via our mod's system.~
~
If you'd like to help out with this documentation project or any other parts of TPPI's 
development, feel free to type the command /tppi getInvolved to learn more.
~~~
Lastly, the /tppi ores command will give you a book on TPPI's unique layer-based 
ore generation system.~
~
Judge has worked very hard on it, and we're very happy that almost everyone sees it as a good change.
~~~
That's about it. Have fun!~
