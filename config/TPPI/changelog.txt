~~~
- Removed Gascraft~
~
- Added Botania. Vazkii is back with his newest mod. We think you will enjoy this one. Note, this mod has worldgen, so you will either need to explore new chunks.~
~~~
- Added ElectroMagicTools. This is a Thaumcraft4/IC2 addon which brings new IC2-like content to the world of Thaumcraft. Find all of the info inside the thaumonomicon.~
~~~
- Added Minetweaker, disabled by default. Server owners, and even some SSPers, this is for you.~

~~~
- Added Thaumic Reliquary. This replaces all Reliquary items with their Thaumcraft-like varient. Reasearch, various TC crafting techniques like infusion and the arcane-worktableing, and even TC items will be required for this mod.~
~~~

~~~
- It will have to be enabled on the server and the other option will have to be enabled on the client. This is great because not everybody will be a huge fan of this like we are. This is much better than having to disable the mod. It is up to you now!~
~~~
